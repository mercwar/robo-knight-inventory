# Contributing to Robo-Knight-Inventory

This repository defines the canonical Robo-Knight v1.00 registration:
armor geometry, stance law, crest placement, and shine behavior.

## Development Guidelines

1. **AIFVS-ARTIFACT Headers**  
   Required for all inventory files and structural definitions.

2. **Canonical Form Preservation**  
   No cape logic, no glow logic, no unauthorized geometry changes.

3. **Stance & Armor Law**  
   Any modification must be justified with lineage and mechanical reasoning.

## How to Submit

- Fork the repository  
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/RK-Inventory-Update`)  
- Submit a Pull Request describing the structural refinement  

*Inventory Law: The Knight’s form must remain pure.*
